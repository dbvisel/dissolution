dissolution
===========

A map of the dissolution of my CD collection. Mostly a way for me to play with Google Maps, nothing particularly special. Online version here: http://withhiddennoise.net/tempo/dissolution.html. 

This is pretty simple! The dissolution.json file contains information about each sale – entered manually because I don't know a way to get it out of Discogs automatically – with the location's latitude ("lat"), longitude ("long"), and the number of CDs sent there ("number").
